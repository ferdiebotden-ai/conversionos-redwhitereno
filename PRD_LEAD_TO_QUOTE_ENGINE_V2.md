## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Problem Statement (Why)

Homeowners seeking renovation quotes face three critical friction points:

1. **Waiting Time:** Traditional quote requests take 2-7 days for initial response
2. **Visualization Gap:** Homeowners struggle to imagine the finished result, creating decision paralysis
3. **Information Asymmetry:** Without ballpark pricing, homeowners cannot assess project feasibility before committing time to consultations

For contractors like Red White Reno:
- Manual quote generation consumes 2-3 hours per lead
- High abandonment on basic contact forms (only 2-3% conversion)
- Difficulty differentiating from competitors with identical websites

| Metric | Current Baseline | Target | Measurement |
|--------|------------------|--------|-------------|
| Visitor-to-Lead Conversion | 2-3% | 8%+ | Analytics: visitors vs completed intakes |
| Intake Completion Rate | N/A | ≥70% | intake_started vs lead_submitted events |
| Time-to-Initial Response | 24-48 hours | <2 hours | Lead submission → quote sent timestamps |
| Quote Preparation Time (Owner) | 2-3 hours | <10 minutes | Draft creation → quote sent timestamps |
| Monthly Lead Volume | 5-8 | 25-40 | Database count |
| Quote Accuracy | N/A | ±15% of final | Post-project comparison |

### 1.4 Non-Goals (What We're NOT Building)

- Full project management system (use existing tools)
- CRM with email sequences (integrate with Mailchimp/HubSpot later)
- Payment processing/invoicing (out of scope for v1)
- 3D walkthrough or AR visualization (photo-to-photo only)
- Contractor marketplace (single contractor per deployment)
- Real-time collaboration/chat with contractor

## 3. Feature 1: AI Quote Assistant

### 3.1 Overview

The AI Quote Assistant is a conversational interface that guides homeowners through a structured intake process, collecting project details and generating instant preliminary estimates. Unlike form-based competitors, this uses natural conversation with adaptive follow-up questions.

**Competitive Differentiation:**
- Handoff.ai requires photo/video upload → generates estimate (no conversation)
- Block Renovation uses form-based input → matches with contractors
- Our approach: Conversational AI that feels like talking to a helpful estimator

### 3.2 User Stories

| QA-US-003 | Homeowner | Save my progress and return later | I can gather more info without losing my work |

### 3.5 Edge Cases & Error Handling

| Scenario | Detection | Response |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| User uploads non-image file | MIME type check | "Please upload a photo (JPG, PNG, HEIC)" |
| User uploads image >10MB | File size check | "This image is too large. I'll compress it for you." (auto-compress) |
| AI cannot identify room type from photo | Low confidence score | "I'm not sure what type of room this is. Could you tell me?" |
| User provides unrealistic budget | Budget vs scope mismatch | "For [scope], typical costs are [range]. Would you like to adjust your expectations or your scope?" |
| User goes off-topic | Intent classification | "I'm here to help with renovation quotes. [redirect to last question]" |
| User provides incomplete info | Required field check | "I need a bit more detail about [missing info] to give you an accurate estimate." |
| API timeout | Error catch | "Give me a moment to think... [retry]" |
| Session expires | 7-day TTL | Email with magic link to resume |
| User abandons mid-flow | intake_abandoned event | Save partial data, trigger follow-up email if email collected |

### 3.7 Implementation Enhancements (Beyond PRD)

The following features were added during implementation based on user testing feedback:

| Enhancement | Description | Rationale |
|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| **Switch to Form Modal** | Users can toggle between chat and form-based project input | Some users prefer structured forms over conversational interfaces |
| **Submit Request Modal** | Explicit 3-step lead submission flow (Review → Contact → Confirm) | Clearer completion path than implicit save |
| **Conditional Photo Step** | Progress indicator only shows photo step if photo was uploaded | Reduces confusion for users who skip photos |
| **Editable Sidebar** | Project details in sidebar are click-to-edit | Quick corrections without re-chatting |
| **No Price Estimates in UI** | Removed visible price estimates from customer-facing sidebar | Prevents sticker shock before contractor review |
| **HEIC Support** | Automatic HEIC → JPEG conversion via heic2any library | Supports iOS users who upload directly from Photos app |

**Key Implementation Files:**
- `src/components/chat/chat-interface.tsx` - Main chat container
- `src/components/chat/project-form-modal.tsx` - Form alternative
- `src/components/chat/submit-request-modal.tsx` - Lead submission flow
- `src/components/chat/estimate-sidebar.tsx` - Editable project summary
- `src/components/chat/quick-replies.tsx` - Animated quick reply buttons
- `src/components/chat/progress-indicator.tsx` - Multi-step progress with conditional steps

## 4. Feature 2: AI Design Visualizer

### 4.1 Overview

The AI Design Visualizer allows homeowners to upload a photo of their current space and receive photorealistic "after" images showing potential renovation outcomes. This uses Nano Banana Pro (Gemini 3 Pro Image) with structure-preserving parameters to maintain room geometry while applying new styles.

**Competitive Reference:**
- Block Renovation Renovation Studio: [blockrenovation.com/renovation-planning](https://www.blockrenovation.com/renovation-planning)
- ReRoom AI: [reroom.ai](https://reroom.ai/)
- RoomGPT: [roomgpt.io](https://www.roomgpt.io/)

**Our Differentiation:**
- Integrated with quote assistant (visualizations influence estimate)
- Contractor-branded output (not generic tool)
- Multiple concepts generated per request (not single image)

### 4.2 User Stories

| ID | As a... | I want to... | So that... |
|----|---------|--------------|------------|
| VIS-US-001 | Homeowner | Upload a photo and see multiple design options | I can explore different styles before deciding |
| VIS-US-002 | Homeowner | Specify constraints like "keep my cabinets" | The visualization is realistic for my situation |
| VIS-US-003 | Homeowner | Compare before/after with an interactive slider | I can clearly see the transformation |
| VIS-US-004 | Homeowner | Take my visualization to the quote assistant | The contractor knows exactly what I want |
| VIS-US-005 | Homeowner | Download and share my visualizations | I can discuss with family/spouse |
| VIS-US-006 | Contractor | See what the customer visualized | I can align expectations from the start |

### 4.7 Implementation Notes

**AI Provider:** Uses native Google Generative AI SDK (`@google/generative-ai`) rather than Vercel AI SDK wrapper for image generation. This provides better control over image generation parameters.

**Storage:** Generated visualizations are stored in Supabase Storage (`visualizations` bucket) and metadata tracked in `visualizations` table.

**Enhancements Beyond PRD:**
| Enhancement | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Shareable View** | Unique share tokens for `/visualizer/share/[token]` - users can share results |
| **Lead Linkage** | Visualizations can be linked to leads when user proceeds to quote |
| **Download Tracking** | Tracks download count and timestamps for analytics |
| **HEIC Conversion** | Automatic HEIC → JPEG conversion for iOS users via heic2any |
| **90s Timeout** | AbortController-based timeout with clear error messaging |

**Key Implementation Files:**
- `src/components/visualizer/visualizer-form.tsx` - Main form component
- `src/components/visualizer/before-after-slider.tsx` - Interactive comparison slider
- `src/lib/ai/gemini.ts` - Native Gemini SDK integration with image generation
- `src/lib/ai/visualization.ts` - Visualization service orchestration
- `src/app/api/ai/visualize/route.ts` - API endpoint

   └── Just submitted, processing
```

### 6.4 AI-Powered Enhancements (DEV-072)

The following AI features were added post-PRD to significantly enhance contractor productivity:

#### 6.4.1 AI Quote Generation

**Purpose:** Auto-generate project-specific line items from chat context instead of requiring manual entry.

**How it works:**
1. When lead is submitted, chat transcript is sent to GPT-5.2
2. AI analyzes project type, scope, finish level, and customer goals
3. Generates specific line items (e.g., "R24 Insulation for exterior walls" not just "Materials")
4. Each line item includes:
   - Description
   - Category (materials, labor, contract, permit, other)
   - Total amount
   - AI reasoning (why this item was included)
   - Confidence score (0-1)
5. AI draft stored in `ai_draft_json` column, separate from admin-edited `line_items`

**Files:**
- `src/lib/ai/quote-generation.ts` - Generation service
- `src/lib/schemas/ai-quote.ts` - Zod schemas

#### 6.4.2 AI Quote Suggestions UI

**Purpose:** Allow contractor to review, accept, modify, or reject AI-generated line items.

**Features:**
- Displays AI suggestions with confidence badges
- One-click "Accept" to add to quote
- Bulk "Accept All" for quick adoption
- "Regenerate" with optional guidance input
- Visual indicator showing AI-generated vs manually-added items
- Expandable reasoning view for each line item

**File:** `src/components/admin/ai-quote-suggestions.tsx`

#### 6.4.3 AI Email Drafting

**Purpose:** Generate personalized quote emails instead of generic templates.

**Context used:**
- Customer name
- Project type and scope
- Quote total and deposit required
- Line item count
- Goals from chat
- Whether this is first send or re-send

**Output:**
- Subject line
- Personalized greeting
- Body paragraphs explaining the quote
- Call-to-action
- Professional closing

**Files:**
- `src/lib/ai/email-generation.ts` - Generation service
- `src/lib/schemas/ai-email.ts` - Zod schemas

#### 6.4.4 Multi-Step Send Wizard

**Purpose:** Quality control flow before sending quotes to customers.

**Steps:**
1. **Review Quote** - Final line items, totals, assumptions, exclusions
2. **Preview PDF** - Embedded PDF preview or download option
3. **Compose Email** - AI-drafted email with full edit capability
4. **Confirm & Send** - Pre-populated recipient, final confirmation

**File:** `src/components/admin/quote-send-wizard.tsx`

#### 6.4.5 Database-Backed Admin Settings

**Purpose:** Configurable pricing and business settings without code changes.

**Settings Table (`admin_settings`):**
| Setting Key | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `pricing_kitchen` | Per-sqft rates for economy/standard/premium |
| `pricing_bathroom` | Per-sqft rates for economy/standard/premium |
| `pricing_basement` | Per-sqft rates for economy/standard/premium |
| `labor_rate_internal` | Hourly rate for in-house labor |
| `labor_markup_contract` | Markup percentage for subcontractors |
| `contingency_percent` | Default contingency percentage |
| `hst_rate` | Provincial HST rate (13% for Ontario) |
| `deposit_percent` | Required deposit percentage |
| `quote_validity_days` | How long quotes are valid |

**Files:**
- `src/app/api/admin/settings/route.ts` - CRUD API
- `src/app/admin/settings/page.tsx` - Settings UI
- `supabase/migrations/20260203000000_ai_quote_settings.sql` - Database migration

## 8. AI Behavior Specification

### 8.1 Quote Assistant System Prompt

```typescript
const QUOTE_ASSISTANT_SYSTEM_PROMPT = `You are the Red White Reno Quote Assistant, a friendly and professional AI that helps homeowners get preliminary renovation estimates in Stratford, Ontario and surrounding areas.

## Your Role
Guide users through the quote intake process by asking relevant questions about their renovation project. You are warm, helpful, and knowledgeable about home renovations.

## Brand Voice
- Professional yet approachable
- Knowledgeable but not condescending
- Enthusiastic about helping people transform their homes
- Use phrases like "Heart of the home" when discussing kitchens
- Reference local Stratford area when relevant

## Conversation Flow
1. Greet warmly and invite them to share a photo of their space
2. If photo provided, analyze and identify room type and current condition
3. Confirm project type and ask about renovation goals
4. Ask about scope (full remodel vs partial updates)
5. Inquire about material preferences and finish level (economy/standard/premium)
6. Ask about timeline expectations
7. Discuss budget range (provide context: "Kitchens typically range from...")
8. Collect contact information
9. Present preliminary estimate with clear disclaimers

## Question Guidelines
- Ask ONE question at a time
- Keep responses to 2-3 sentences maximum
- Provide helpful context when asking about budget ranges
- Use quick-reply options when appropriate
- Acknowledge user's responses before moving to next question

## Pricing Guidelines (for internal calculation only - NEVER share these directly)
- Kitchen remodel: $150-$300 per sqft depending on finish level
- Bathroom remodel: $200-$400 per sqft depending on scope
- Basement finishing: $40-$80 per sqft depending on features
- Internal labor rate: $85/hour
- Contract labor markup: 15% management fee
- HST: 13% (Ontario)
- Deposit: 50% required

## Estimate Presentation Rules
- ALWAYS present as a RANGE (e.g., "$25,000 - $32,000")
- Apply ±15% variance to calculated values
- Include the standard disclaimer
- Break down into Materials, Labor, and HST
- Mention deposit requirement

## Standard Disclaimer (include with every estimate)
"This is a preliminary AI-generated estimate based on the information you've shared. Final pricing requires an in-person assessment and may vary based on site conditions, material selections, and scope changes. This estimate is valid for 30 days."

## Handling Edge Cases
- If budget seems unrealistic: Gently note typical costs and offer to adjust scope
- If scope is unclear: Ask clarifying questions before estimating
- If off-topic: Politely redirect to renovation discussion
- If frustrated: Offer to have a human follow up directly
- If asking about services not offered: Explain Red White Reno's focus areas

## Contact Collection
When collecting contact info, explain why: "So we can send you a detailed quote and answer any questions, could you share your name, email, and phone number?"

## Visualization Integration
If user mentions they used the visualizer, acknowledge it: "I see you've already visualized your space! That design will be included in your quote for our team to review."

IMPORTANT: Never make binding commitments on pricing. Always frame as preliminary estimates requiring verification.`;
```

});
```

### 8.3 Fallback Behaviors

| Scenario | Detection | Fallback Action |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|
| OpenAI API timeout | 30s timeout | Retry once, then show "Taking longer than expected..." with option to leave email |
| OpenAI API error | 5xx status | Show friendly error, offer to email when ready |
| Gemini API timeout | 90s timeout | Show "Generation taking longer than usual", offer email delivery |
| Gemini API error | Any error | Show graceful message, suggest trying different photo |
| Low confidence extraction | confidence < 0.6 | Flag for human review, ask clarifying questions |
| Invalid/offensive image | Content filter | Reject politely: "I can only analyze renovation-related photos" |
| Rate limit hit | 429 status | Queue request, show position in queue |
| Session expired | 7-day TTL | Offer to send magic link to email to resume |

### 8.4 Content Moderation

All uploaded images pass through content moderation:

```typescript
const moderationCheck = async (imageBase64: string) => {
  const result = await openai.moderations.create({
    model: 'omni-moderation-latest',
    input: [{ type: 'image_url', image_url: { url: `data:image/jpeg;base64,${imageBase64}` } }],
  });

  if (result.results[0].flagged) {
    throw new ContentModerationError('Image does not appear to be renovation-related');
  }

  return true;
};
```

| **Swipe Gestures** | Gallery swipe, before/after reveal |
| **Camera Integration** | Direct camera access for photo upload |
| **Sticky Elements** | Floating CTA button, estimate summary bar |
| **Keyboard Handling** | Input field scrolls into view, keyboard avoidance |
| **Orientation** | Lock to portrait for chat, allow landscape for visualizer results |
| **Haptic Feedback** | Subtle vibration on button press (if supported) |

### 9.5 Accessibility Requirements

| Requirement | Implementation |
|-------------|----------------|
| Keyboard Navigation | Full keyboard access, visible focus states |
| Screen Reader | ARIA labels, live regions for chat updates |
| Color Contrast | WCAG AA (4.5:1 for text, 3:1 for large text) |
| Text Scaling | Supports up to 200% zoom without horizontal scroll |
| Motion | Respect prefers-reduced-motion for animations |
| Alt Text | Descriptive alt text for all images |
| Form Labels | Visible labels (not just placeholders) |
| Error Messages | Associated with inputs, announced by screen readers |

### Total Actual Hours: ~300 hours (~7.5 weeks)

### 11.1 Lessons Learned

| Area | Lesson |
|------|--------|
| **AI Provider Selection** | Native Google SDK for image generation was more reliable than Vercel AI SDK wrapper |
| **Testing Strategy** | Playwright with 3 viewports (mobile/tablet/desktop) catches most responsive issues |
| **Security** | Role-based admin access via `app_metadata.role` more reliable than RLS policies alone |
| **User Testing** | Form alternative to chat (P6) was highly requested - some users prefer structured input |
| **Error Handling** | 90-second timeout with clear messaging for AI generation is essential UX |
| **Database Design** | Storing AI draft separately (`ai_draft_json`) from edited version (`line_items`) preserves history |

## 15. AI Stack Validation (January 31, 2026)

### 15.1 Validated Technology Choices

The following AI technologies have been researched and validated as of January 31, 2026:

| Component | Technology | Validation Status | Notes |
|-----------|------------|-------------------|-------|
| **Chat AI** | OpenAI GPT-5.2 | VALIDATED | Released Dec 11, 2025. Use GPT-5.2-Instant for real-time chat, GPT-5.2-Thinking for complex extraction. 400K context window, 128K output tokens. |
| **Vision AI** | OpenAI GPT-5.2 Vision | VALIDATED | Multimodal capabilities included in GPT-5.2. Excellent for room analysis and photo interpretation. |
| **Image Gen** | Google Gemini 3 Pro Image (Nano Banana Pro) | VALIDATED | Best for renovation visualization. Supports structure-preserving edits and up to 4K resolution. Use `structureReferenceStrength: 0.85` for room geometry preservation. |
| **Voice Input** | Browser Native Speech API | VALIDATED for v1 | Simple, cost-effective. No additional API costs. |
| **Voice (v2)** | OpenAI Realtime API | FUTURE | $32/1M audio input, $64/1M output tokens. Add in v1.5/v2 for enhanced conversational experience. |
| **Estimation** | Internal Pricing Guidelines | VALIDATED | RSMeans Data ($1,000+/year) is overkill for SMB. Internal guidelines with contractor input are more practical and maintainable. |

### 15.2 Alternative Considerations

| Alternative | Considered For | Decision |
|-------------|----------------|----------|
| Imagen 3 (Vertex AI) | Image generation | Consider for highest photorealistic quality. Requires Vertex AI setup. Gemini 3 Pro Image is simpler for MVP. |
| Claude 3.5 Sonnet | Chat AI | GPT-5.2 selected for consistency with vision/realtime ecosystem. Claude remains viable alternative. |
| ElevenLabs | Voice synthesis | Not needed for v1. Consider for quote read-back in v2. |

### 15.3 API Pricing Reference (as of Jan 2026)

| API | Tier | Price | Est. Monthly Cost |
|-----|------|-------|-------------------|
| GPT-5.2-Instant | Input | $5/1M tokens | ~$15 (500 leads/mo) |
| GPT-5.2-Instant | Output | $20/1M tokens | ~$40 (500 leads/mo) |
| Gemini 3 Pro Image | Generation | $0.02/image | ~$40 (2000 images/mo) |
| Supabase | Free tier | $0 | $0 (up to 500MB) |
| Vercel | Pro | $20/mo | $20 |
| Resend | Free tier | $0 | $0 (100 emails/day) |
| **Total Estimated** | | | **~$115/month** |

### 15.4 Implementation Packages

```bash
# Required AI packages

```typescript
// lib/ai/config.ts
export const AI_CONFIG = {
  openai: {
    chat: 'gpt-5.2-instant',        // Fast responses
    extraction: 'gpt-5.2-thinking', // Complex reasoning
    vision: 'gpt-5.2-instant',      // Photo analysis
    moderation: 'omni-moderation-latest',
  },
  google: {
    imageGen: 'gemini-3-pro-image-preview', // Nano Banana Pro
  },
  parameters: {
    visualization: {
      structureReferenceStrength: 0.85, // Preserve room geometry
      styleStrength: 0.4,               // Apply style subtly
      outputCount: 4,                   // 4 variations
      resolution: '1920x1080',          // HD output
    },
    chat: {
      maxTokens: 1024,                  // Keep responses concise
      temperature: 0.7,                 // Balanced creativity
    },
    extraction: {
      maxTokens: 2048,                  // Allow detailed extraction
      temperature: 0.3,                 // More deterministic
    },
  },
};
```

## 16. White-Label Configuration Guide

This platform is designed for easy deployment to multiple renovation contractors. The architecture separates branding, content, and configuration from core logic.

### 16.1 Branding Configuration

| Element | Location | How to Change |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| **Primary Color** | `tailwind.config.ts`, `src/app/globals.css` | Change `#D32F2F` to contractor brand color |
| **Company Name** | `CLAUDE.md`, system prompts, email templates | Search & replace "Red White Reno" |
| **Logo** | `public/images/`, `<Header>`, `<Footer>`, PDF template | Replace logo files (PNG, 200x60px recommended) |
| **Contact Info** | `src/components/footer.tsx`, email templates | Update address, phone, email |
| **Location** | System prompts, PDF template | Update city/province references (e.g., "Stratford, Ontario") |
| **Social Links** | `src/components/footer.tsx` | Update social media URLs |

### 16.2 Pricing Configuration

All pricing is database-driven via the `admin_settings` table. No code changes required.

| Setting Key | Description | Admin UI Location |
|-------------|-------------|-------------------|
| `pricing_kitchen` | Per-sqft rates for economy/standard/premium | /admin/settings → Pricing tab |
| `pricing_bathroom` | Per-sqft rates for economy/standard/premium | /admin/settings → Pricing tab |
| `pricing_basement` | Per-sqft rates for economy/standard/premium | /admin/settings → Pricing tab |
| `labor_rate_internal` | Hourly rate for in-house labor | /admin/settings → Rates tab |
| `labor_markup_contract` | Markup percentage for subcontractors | /admin/settings → Rates tab |
| `contingency_percent` | Default contingency percentage | /admin/settings → Rates tab |
| `hst_rate` | Provincial tax rate | /admin/settings → Rates tab |
| `deposit_percent` | Required deposit percentage | /admin/settings → Rates tab |
| `quote_validity_days` | How long quotes are valid | /admin/settings → Rates tab |

### 16.3 Service Types

To add or modify service types:

| File | What to Change |
|------|----------------|
| `src/types/database.ts` | Add to `project_type` enum TypeScript type |
| `src/lib/pricing/constants.ts` | Add pricing guidelines for new type |
| `src/lib/ai/prompts.ts` | Update system prompts to mention new service |
| `src/lib/schemas/ai-quote.ts` | Add to LINE_ITEM_TEMPLATES |
| Database | Add constraint to `leads.project_type` column |

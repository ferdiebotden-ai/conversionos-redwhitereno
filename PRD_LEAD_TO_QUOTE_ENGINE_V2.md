## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Problem Statement (Why)

Homeowners seeking renovation quotes face three critical friction points:

1. **Waiting Time:** Traditional quote requests take 2-7 days for initial response
2. **Visualization Gap:** Homeowners struggle to imagine the finished result, creating decision paralysis
3. **Information Asymmetry:** Without ballpark pricing, homeowners cannot assess project feasibility before committing time to consultations

For contractors like Red White Reno:
- Manual quote generation consumes 2-3 hours per lead
- High abandonment on basic contact forms (only 2-3% conversion)
- Difficulty differentiating from competitors with identical websites

## 3. Feature 1: AI Quote Assistant

### 3.1 Overview

The AI Quote Assistant is a conversational interface that guides homeowners through a structured intake process, collecting project details and generating instant preliminary estimates. Unlike form-based competitors, this uses natural conversation with adaptive follow-up questions.

**Competitive Differentiation:**
- Handoff.ai requires photo/video upload → generates estimate (no conversation)
- Block Renovation uses form-based input → matches with contractors
- Our approach: Conversational AI that feels like talking to a helpful estimator

### 3.2 User Stories

| ID | As a... | I want to... | So that... |

| QA-US-001 | Homeowner | Upload a photo and describe my project in natural language | I don't have to fill out tedious forms |
| QA-US-002 | Homeowner | Get an instant ballpark estimate | I can assess feasibility before committing time |
| QA-US-003 | Homeowner | Save my progress and return later | I can gather more info without losing my work |

| QA-US-005 | Contractor | Receive a structured summary of the lead's needs | I can prepare for conversations efficiently |
| QA-US-006 | Contractor | See the AI's reasoning for the estimate | I can adjust confidently |

### 3.7 Additional UX Features

| Enhancement | Description | Rationale |
|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| **Switch to Form Modal** | Users can toggle between chat and form-based project input | Some users prefer structured forms over conversational interfaces |
| **Submit Request Modal** | Explicit 3-step lead submission flow (Review → Contact → Confirm) | Clearer completion path than implicit save |
| **Conditional Photo Step** | Progress indicator only shows photo step if photo was uploaded | Reduces confusion for users who skip photos |
| **Editable Sidebar** | Project details in sidebar are click-to-edit | Quick corrections without re-chatting |
| **No Price Estimates in UI** | Customer-facing sidebar shows project details only, not price estimates | Prevents sticker shock before contractor review |
| **HEIC Support** | Automatic HEIC → JPEG conversion via heic2any library | Supports iOS users who upload directly from Photos app |

**Key Implementation Files:**
- `src/components/chat/chat-interface.tsx` - Main chat container
- `src/components/chat/project-form-modal.tsx` - Form alternative
- `src/components/chat/submit-request-modal.tsx` - Lead submission flow
- `src/components/chat/estimate-sidebar.tsx` - Editable project summary
- `src/components/chat/progress-indicator.tsx` - Multi-step progress with conditional steps
- `src/components/chat/voice-mode.tsx` - Real-time voice conversation

### 3.8 Voice Mode (OpenAI Realtime API)

All three AI agents support real-time voice conversation using OpenAI's Realtime API with WebRTC. Each agent uses a persona-specific voice prompt and voice ID (see Section 9: AI Agent Personas). This enables natural spoken dialogue for users who prefer voice over typing.

**Technical Architecture:**
```
┌─────────────┐     WebRTC      ┌──────────────────┐
│   Browser   │◄───────────────▶│ OpenAI Realtime  │
│  (voice-    │                 │     API          │
│   mode.tsx) │                 │  (gpt-realtime)  │
└──────┬──────┘                 └──────────────────┘
       │
       │ POST /api/realtime/session?persona={key}
       ▼
┌─────────────┐
│  Next.js    │  → Reads persona key from query param
│   API       │  → Builds voice-optimized prompt via buildVoiceSystemPrompt()
│             │  → Generates ephemeral client token with persona voice ID
└─────────────┘
```

**Persona-Based Voice:**

| Agent | Persona Key | Voice ID | Available From |
|-------|-------------|----------|----------------|
| Receptionist | `receptionist` | `shimmer` | Chat widget mic button |
| Quote Specialist | `quote-specialist` | `echo` | `/estimate` voice button |
| Design Consultant | `design-consultant` | `shimmer` | `/visualizer` mic button |

The `?persona=` query parameter defaults to `quote-specialist` for backward compatibility.

**User Flow:**
1. Click voice/mic button in the respective chat interface
2. System checks browser support and API availability (shows loading state)
3. Click "Start Conversation" (full voice mode) or auto-connect (widget compact mode)
4. Speak naturally — AI responds with voice audio using the agent's persona
5. Transcript appears in real-time during conversation
6. Click "Submit Transcript" to transfer conversation to text chat
7. Continue in text mode or submit lead

**Features:**
- Real-time audio transcription (both user and AI)
- Audio visualizer showing voice activity (brand-colored gradient)
- Mute/unmute toggle
- Connection timeout (15s) prevents infinite spinner
- API configuration check prevents cryptic errors
- Graceful fallback to text chat on errors
- Compact mode for the receptionist widget (fits in panel without full-screen takeover)
- Voice-optimized prompts (1-2 sentence responses, one topic at a time, verbal acknowledgments)

**Error Handling:**
| Error Condition | User Message | Action |
|-----------------|--------------|--------|
| No microphone access | "Please allow microphone access..." | Prompt for permission |
| Browser not supported | "Voice mode requires a modern browser..." | Offer text chat |
| API not configured | "Voice mode is not available..." | Offer text chat |
| Connection timeout | "Connection timed out..." | Retry or text chat |
| Session expired | "Your voice session has expired..." | Start new session |

**Environment Requirements:**
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` must be set in environment
- Modern browser with WebRTC support (Chrome, Edge, Safari)

**Key Implementation Files:**
- `src/components/chat/voice-mode.tsx` - Full voice UI and WebRTC logic (quote/visualizer)
- `src/components/receptionist/receptionist-voice.tsx` - Compact voice mode (widget)
- `src/app/api/realtime/session/route.ts` - Session token endpoint (accepts `?persona=` param)
- `src/app/api/realtime/check/route.ts` - API configuration check
- `src/lib/realtime/config.ts` - Constants and types
- `src/lib/ai/personas/prompt-assembler.ts` - `buildVoiceSystemPrompt()` builder

## 4. Feature 2: AI Design Visualizer

### 4.1 Overview

The AI Design Visualizer allows homeowners to upload a photo of their current space and receive photorealistic "after" images showing potential renovation outcomes. This uses Nano Banana Pro (Gemini 3 Pro Image) with structure-preserving parameters to maintain room geometry while applying new styles.

**Competitive Reference:**
- Block Renovation Renovation Studio: [blockrenovation.com/renovation-planning](https://www.blockrenovation.com/renovation-planning)
- ReRoom AI: [reroom.ai](https://reroom.ai/)
- RoomGPT: [roomgpt.io](https://www.roomgpt.io/)

**Our Differentiation:**
- Integrated with quote assistant (visualizations influence estimate)
- Contractor-branded output (not generic tool)
- Multiple concepts generated per request (not single image)

### 4.2 User Stories

| ID | As a... | I want to... | So that... |
|----|---------|--------------|------------|

### 4.5 Generation Parameters (for Nano Banana Pro)

```typescript
// API call structure for visualization
const visualizationConfig = {
  model: 'gemini-3-pro-image-preview',
  structureReferenceStrength: 0.90, // Very high: preserve room geometry
  styleStrength: 0.4, // Moderate: apply style without overwhelming
  referenceImages: [userUploadedImage], // Can accept up to 14 reference images
  prompt: buildRenovationPrompt(promptData), // 6-part structured prompt
  outputCount: 4, // Generate 4 variations
  resolution: '2048x2048', // High-quality square output
  responseModalities: ['image', 'text'] // Include text description
};
```

### 4.5.1 Enhanced Prompt System

The visualizer uses a 6-part structured prompt for better results:

1. **Scene Description** - Narrative description of the desired renovation
2. **Structural Preservation** - Critical instructions for maintaining room geometry
3. **Material & Finish Specifications** - Specific materials, not generic descriptions
4. **Lighting Instructions** - Match original photo lighting conditions
5. **Perspective Instructions** - Maintain exact camera angle from original
6. **Quality Modifiers** - Photorealistic output requirements

### 4.5.2 Photo Analysis (GPT Vision)

Before generation, photos are analyzed using GPT-4o Vision to extract:

| Data Point | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| Room type detection | Auto-select room type |
| Current condition | Inform renovation scope |
| Structural elements | Identify what must be preserved |
| Identified fixtures | Understand existing features |
| Layout type | Guide prompt construction |
| Lighting conditions | Match in generated images |
| Perspective notes | Maintain camera angle |
| Preservation constraints | Critical "do not change" elements |

### 4.5.3 Quality Validation

Generated images undergo structure preservation validation:

1. GPT Vision compares original and generated images
2. Validates room geometry, window positions, camera angle preserved
3. If validation fails (score < 0.7), automatically retries with stronger structure emphasis
4. Maximum 3 retry attempts to balance quality and cost

### 4.6 Operating Modes

The visualizer supports two modes to balance convenience and personalization:

| Mode | Description | Best For |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Conversation Mode** (default) | AI chat gathers design intent through natural conversation before generating | Users who want personalized, context-aware results |
| **Quick Mode** | Traditional 4-step form: Photo → Room → Style → Constraints | Users in a hurry who know what they want |

**Conversation Mode Flow:**
1. User uploads photo
2. Photo is analyzed by GPT Vision
3. AI describes what it sees and asks about desired changes
4. Natural back-and-forth (3-5 turns) to understand:
   - Specific changes wanted
   - Elements to preserve
   - Style preferences
   - Material preferences
5. When ready, user clicks "Generate Visualization"
6. Richer context produces more relevant results

**Quick Mode Flow:**
1. Upload Photo → 2. Select Room Type → 3. Choose Style → 4. Add Constraints (optional) → Generate

### 4.7 UI/UX Wireframe Description

**Desktop Layout (Quick Mode):**

### 6.3 Lead Status Workflow

```
[NEW] → [DRAFT_READY] → [NEEDS_CLARIFICATION] → [SENT] → [WON/LOST]
   │          │                    │               │
   │          │                    │               └── Client accepted/declined
   │          │                    └── Missing info, follow-up needed
   │          └── AI draft generated, ready for owner review
   └── Just submitted, processing
```

### 6.4 AI-Powered Enhancements

#### 6.4.1 AI Quote Generation

**Purpose:** Auto-generate project-specific line items from chat context instead of requiring manual entry.

**How it works:**
1. When lead is submitted, chat transcript is sent to GPT-5.2
2. AI analyzes project type, scope, finish level, and customer goals
3. Generates specific line items (e.g., "R24 Insulation for exterior walls" not just "Materials")
4. Each line item includes:
   - Description
   - Category (materials, labor, contract, permit, other)
   - Total amount
   - AI reasoning (why this item was included)
   - Confidence score (0-1)
5. AI draft stored in `ai_draft_json` column, separate from admin-edited `line_items`

**Files:**
- `src/lib/ai/quote-generation.ts` - Generation service
- `src/lib/schemas/ai-quote.ts` - Zod schemas

- "Regenerate" with optional guidance input
- Visual indicator showing AI-generated vs manually-added items
- Expandable reasoning view for each line item

**File:** `src/components/admin/ai-quote-suggestions.tsx`

#### 6.4.3 AI Email Drafting

**Purpose:** Generate personalized quote emails instead of generic templates.

**Context used:**
- Customer name
- Project type and scope
- Quote total and deposit required
- Line item count

## 9. Feature 7: AI Agent Personas & Smart Chat Widget

### 9.1 Overview

The platform features three named AI agent personas, each with a distinct role, personality, and knowledge base. A floating chat widget provides instant AI engagement on every public page without requiring navigation. This follows industry best practices from Lemonade (Maya), Wealthsimple (Willow), and other platforms where named, personality-driven AI agents measurably outperform generic chatbots in trust-building and lead conversion.

**Competitive Differentiation:**
- Named AI personas build trust and brand personality (vs anonymous "AI Assistant")
- Floating chat widget provides zero-navigation engagement on every public page
- Proactive teaser bubbles with page-specific messaging (105% incremental ROI per Forrester)
- All three agents share a unified knowledge base with role-specific depth
- Professional sales training baked into all agent prompts (conversational lead capture, objection handling)
- Each agent supports both text and voice modes with persona-specific voice prompts

### 9.2 Agent Personas

| Agent | Default Name | Role | Pages | Mode |
|-------|-------------|------|-------|------|
| Receptionist | Emma | Virtual Receptionist | All public pages (except `/estimate`, `/visualizer`, `/admin/*`) | Text + Voice (in widget) |
| Quote Specialist | Marcus | Budget & Cost Specialist | `/estimate` (existing chat) | Text + Voice |
| Design Consultant | Mia | Design Consultant | `/visualizer` (existing chat) | Text + Voice |

Each persona is defined by an `AgentPersona` interface:
- `name`, `role`, `tagline`, `greeting` — identity and first impression
- `personalityTraits` — shapes tone and language style
- `capabilities` — what this agent can help with
- `boundaries` — what this agent should NOT do (routes to the right agent instead)
- `routingSuggestions` — how to hand off to other agents with embedded CTAs
- `voiceId` — OpenAI Realtime voice for voice mode

### 9.3 Knowledge Base Architecture

All agents draw from shared, modular knowledge modules. Each module exports string constants consumed by the prompt assembler.

| Module | Content | Used By |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `company.ts` | Company profile, team, hours, service area, social links, website pages | All agents |
| `services.ts` | Detailed service scopes (room-by-room), what each includes | All agents |
| `pricing.ts` | Per-sqft pricing by room/tier, labor rate, markup, tax, deposit, contingency | Quote Specialist (full), Receptionist (summary) |
| `ontario-renovation.ts` | Permits, building code, tax, seasonal considerations, WSIB, energy incentives, common housing stock, climate-appropriate materials. Sub-exports: budget-focused and design-focused variants | All agents (role-appropriate variant) |
| `sales-techniques.ts` | Conversational lead capture, objection handling, human-sounding speech, the "yes ladder", lead capture timing, relationship building, urgency without pressure | All agents |

### 9.4 System Prompt Layering

Prompts are assembled in four layers by `buildAgentSystemPrompt(personaKey)`:

```
Layer 1: Company + Services (shared, scope varies by agent)
  - Receptionist: Full company profile + service summary + general Ontario knowledge
  - Quote Specialist: Company summary + detailed service scopes
  - Design Consultant: Company summary + service summary

Layer 2: Role-specific knowledge
  - Receptionist: Pricing summary (ranges only)
  - Quote Specialist: Full pricing details + Ontario budget knowledge
  - Design Consultant: Ontario design knowledge

Layer 3: Sales training (shared by all agents)

Layer 4: Persona identity + boundaries + routing + conversation rules
```

Voice prompts use `buildVoiceSystemPrompt(personaKey)` — same knowledge, but with voice-specific rules (1-2 sentence responses, one topic at a time, verbal acknowledgments, no formatting).

### 9.5 Smart Chat Widget

The receptionist widget is a floating UI element available on all public pages.

**FAB (Floating Action Button):**
- Bottom-right corner, brand primary color, `MessageCircle` icon (industry standard)
- 56px desktop, 48px mobile
- Subtle pulse animation on first load (3s), then stops
- Morphs to X icon when panel is open

**Proactive Teaser Bubble:**
- Appears 6 seconds after page load (research-backed optimal timing)
- Page-specific contextual messages (e.g., services page: "Questions about our services?", projects page: "Love what you see? Let's plan yours.")
- Dismissible (X button or clicking FAB to open panel)
- Does NOT auto-open the full panel (anti-pattern per research)

**Chat Panel:**
- Fixed position, slide-up + fade animation (~250ms)
- 400px max-width, 520px height, rounded corners, elevated shadow
- Header: Agent avatar + name + company name + close button
- Uses Vercel AI SDK `useChat` with streaming via `/api/ai/receptionist`
- Renders inline CTA buttons parsed from `[CTA:Label:/path]` markers in responses
- Includes compact voice mode (WebRTC, fits in panel without full-screen takeover)

**Visibility Logic:**
- **Hidden on:** `/estimate`, `/visualizer`, `/admin/*` (these pages have their own AI chat)
- **Visible on:** `/`, `/services/*`, `/about`, `/contact`, `/projects`, all other public pages

### 9.6 CTA Embedding

The receptionist agent's prompt includes instructions to embed `[CTA:Label:/path]` markers when suggesting navigation. The widget parses these with regex and renders them as clickable `Button` components with Next.js `Link`.

Example AI response: "Want a ballpark estimate? [CTA:Get a Free Estimate:/estimate]"
Renders as: text message + a clickable "Get a Free Estimate" button that navigates to `/estimate`.

## 11. AI Behavior Specification

### 11.1 AI Agent Persona System

The platform uses a **layered persona system** rather than a single hardcoded system prompt. Each AI agent has a distinct named persona with role-specific knowledge, and all agents share a common knowledge base and sales training layer. This architecture is brand-agnostic — persona definitions and knowledge modules contain the deployment-specific content (company name, location, pricing, services), while the prompt assembly logic is universal.

#### Prompt Assembly Architecture

System prompts are built dynamically via `buildAgentSystemPrompt(personaKey)` in four layers:

```
Layer 1: Company Profile + Service Catalog (shared by all agents)
  └── Loaded from knowledge modules: company.ts, services.ts

Layer 2: Role-Specific Knowledge
  ├── Receptionist: company-full + ontario-general + pricing-summary
  ├── Quote Specialist: pricing-full + ontario-budget + service-scopes + estimate rules
  └── Design Consultant: ontario-design + style descriptions + room analysis

Layer 3: Sales Training (shared by all agents)
  └── Conversational techniques, lead capture timing, objection handling

Layer 4: Persona Identity + Boundaries + Routing Rules
  └── Name, personality traits, greeting, capabilities, what NOT to do
```

#### Voice Prompt Variant

`buildVoiceSystemPrompt(personaKey)` builds a voice-optimized version with the same knowledge layers but voice-specific behavioral rules:
- Keep responses to 1-2 sentences maximum
- One topic at a time (no lists or formatting)
- Use verbal acknowledgments ("Got it", "Makes sense")
- Speak naturally with contractions and conversational flow

#### Key Behavior Rules (All Agents)

**Conversation Flow (Quote Specialist):**
1. Greet warmly and invite photo upload
2. Analyze photo if provided (room type, condition)
3. Confirm project type, ask about renovation goals
4. Ask about scope (full vs. partial)
5. Inquire about material preferences and finish level
6. Discuss timeline and budget range with context
7. Collect contact information
8. Present preliminary estimate with disclaimers

**Question Guidelines:**
- Ask ONE question at a time
- Keep responses to 2-3 sentences
- Acknowledge user's response before moving forward

**Estimate Presentation:**
- Always present as a RANGE (e.g., "$25,000 - $32,000")
- Apply ±15% variance to calculated values
- Break down into Materials, Labor, and applicable tax
- Include deposit requirement
- Always include standard disclaimer about preliminary nature

**Edge Case Handling:**
- Unrealistic budget → gently note typical costs, offer scope adjustment
- Unclear scope → ask clarifying questions before estimating
- Off-topic → politely redirect to renovation discussion
- Frustrated user → offer human follow-up
- Unsupported service → explain available service areas

**Contact Collection:**
Explain the value: "So we can send you a detailed quote and answer any questions, could you share your name, email, and phone number?"

**Standard Disclaimer (included with every estimate):**
"This is a preliminary AI-generated estimate based on the information you've shared. Final pricing requires an in-person assessment and may vary based on site conditions, material selections, and scope changes. This estimate is valid for 30 days."

### 11.3 Fallback Behaviors

| Scenario | Detection | Fallback Action |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|
| OpenAI API timeout | 30s timeout | Retry once, then show "Taking longer than expected..." with option to leave email |
| OpenAI API error | 5xx status | Show friendly error, offer to email when ready |
| Gemini API timeout | 90s timeout | Show "Generation taking longer than usual", offer email delivery |
| Gemini API error | Any error | Show graceful message, suggest trying different photo |
| Low confidence extraction | confidence < 0.6 | Flag for human review, ask clarifying questions |
| Invalid/offensive image | Content filter | Reject politely: "I can only analyze renovation-related photos" |
| Rate limit hit | 429 status | Queue request, show position in queue |
| Session expired | 7-day TTL | Offer to send magic link to email to resume |

### 11.4 Content Moderation

All uploaded images pass through content moderation:

```typescript
const moderationCheck = async (imageBase64: string) => {
  const result = await openai.moderations.create({
    model: 'omni-moderation-latest',
    input: [{ type: 'image_url', image_url: { url: `data:image/jpeg;base64,${imageBase64}` } }],
  });

  if (result.results[0].flagged) {
    throw new ContentModerationError('Image does not appear to be renovation-related');
  }

  return true;
};
```

### 12.4 Mobile-Specific Patterns

| Pattern | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|
| **Thumb Zone Navigation** | CTAs in bottom 30% of screen, sticky footer on quote pages |
| **Touch Targets** | Minimum 48x48px for all interactive elements |
| **Swipe Gestures** | Gallery swipe, before/after reveal |
| **Camera Integration** | Direct camera access for photo upload |
| **Sticky Elements** | Floating CTA button, estimate summary bar |
| **Keyboard Handling** | Input field scrolls into view, keyboard avoidance |
| **Orientation** | Lock to portrait for chat, allow landscape for visualizer results |
| **Haptic Feedback** | Subtle vibration on button press (if supported) |

### 12.5 Accessibility Requirements

| Requirement | Implementation |
|-------------|----------------|
| Keyboard Navigation | Full keyboard access, visible focus states |
| Screen Reader | ARIA labels, live regions for chat updates |
| Color Contrast | WCAG AA (4.5:1 for text, 3:1 for large text) |
| Text Scaling | Supports up to 200% zoom without horizontal scroll |
| Motion | Respect prefers-reduced-motion for animations |
| Alt Text | Descriptive alt text for all images |
| Form Labels | Visible labels (not just placeholders) |
| Error Messages | Associated with inputs, announced by screen readers |

### Total Actual Hours: ~490 hours (~9 weeks)

### 14.1 Lessons Learned

| Area | Lesson |
|------|--------|
| **AI Provider Selection** | Native Google SDK for image generation was more reliable than Vercel AI SDK wrapper |
| **Testing Strategy** | Playwright with 3 viewports (mobile/tablet/desktop) catches most responsive issues |
| **Security** | Role-based admin access via `app_metadata.role` more reliable than RLS policies alone |
| **User Testing** | Form alternative to chat (P6) was highly requested - some users prefer structured input |
| **Error Handling** | 90-second timeout with clear messaging for AI generation is essential UX |
| **Database Design** | Storing AI draft separately (`ai_draft_json`) from edited version (`line_items`) preserves history |

## 18. AI Stack Validation (January 31, 2026)

### 18.1 Validated Technology Choices

The following AI technologies have been researched and validated as of January 31, 2026:

| Component | Technology | Validation Status | Notes |
|-----------|------------|-------------------|-------|
| **Chat AI** | OpenAI GPT-5.2 | VALIDATED | Released Dec 11, 2025. Use GPT-5.2-Instant for real-time chat, GPT-5.2-Thinking for complex extraction. 400K context window, 128K output tokens. |
| **Vision AI** | OpenAI GPT-5.2 Vision | VALIDATED | Multimodal capabilities included in GPT-5.2. Excellent for room analysis and photo interpretation. |
| **Image Gen** | Google Gemini 3 Pro Image (Nano Banana Pro) | VALIDATED | Best for renovation visualization. Supports structure-preserving edits and up to 4K resolution. Use `structureReferenceStrength: 0.85` for room geometry preservation. |
| **Voice Mode** | OpenAI Realtime API | VALIDATED | Real-time voice conversation via WebRTC. Enables natural spoken dialogue for renovation project descriptions. See Section 3.8. |
| **Estimation** | Internal Pricing Guidelines | VALIDATED | RSMeans Data ($1,000+/year) is overkill for SMB. Internal guidelines with contractor input are more practical and maintainable. |

### 18.2 Alternative Considerations

| Alternative | Considered For | Decision |
|-------------|----------------|----------|
| Imagen 3 (Vertex AI) | Image generation | Consider for highest photorealistic quality. Requires Vertex AI setup. Gemini 3 Pro Image is simpler for MVP. |
| Claude 3.5 Sonnet | Chat AI | GPT-5.2 selected for consistency with vision/realtime ecosystem. Claude remains viable alternative. |
| ElevenLabs | Voice synthesis | Not needed for v1. Consider for quote read-back in v2. |

### 18.3 API Pricing Reference (as of Jan 2026)

| API | Tier | Price | Est. Monthly Cost |
|-----|------|-------|-------------------|
| GPT-5.2-Instant | Input | $5/1M tokens | ~$15 (500 leads/mo) |
| GPT-5.2-Instant | Output | $20/1M tokens | ~$40 (500 leads/mo) |
| Gemini 3 Pro Image | Generation | $0.02/image | ~$40 (2000 images/mo) |
| Supabase | Free tier | $0 | $0 (up to 500MB) |
| Vercel | Pro | $20/mo | $20 |
| Resend | Free tier | $0 | $0 (100 emails/day) |
| **Total Estimated** | | | **~$115/month** |

### 18.4 Implementation Packages

```bash
# Required AI packages
npm install ai @ai-sdk/openai @ai-sdk/google zod

# Required infrastructure

```

### 18.5 Model Configuration

```typescript
// lib/ai/config.ts
export const AI_CONFIG = {
  openai: {
    chat: 'gpt-5.2-instant',        // Fast responses
    extraction: 'gpt-5.2-thinking', // Complex reasoning
    vision: 'gpt-5.2-instant',      // Photo analysis
    moderation: 'omni-moderation-latest',
  },
  google: {
    imageGen: 'gemini-3-pro-image-preview', // Nano Banana Pro
  },
  parameters: {
    visualization: {
      structureReferenceStrength: 0.85, // Preserve room geometry
      styleStrength: 0.4,               // Apply style subtly
      outputCount: 4,                   // 4 variations
      resolution: '1920x1080',          // HD output
    },
    chat: {
      maxTokens: 1024,                  // Keep responses concise
      temperature: 0.7,                 // Balanced creativity
    },
    extraction: {
      maxTokens: 2048,                  // Allow detailed extraction
      temperature: 0.3,                 // More deterministic
    },
  },
};
```

## 19. White-Label Configuration Guide

This platform is designed for easy deployment to multiple renovation contractors. The architecture separates branding, content, and configuration from core logic.

### 19.1 Branding Configuration

| Element | Location | How to Change |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| **Primary Color** | `tailwind.config.ts`, `src/app/globals.css` | Change `#D32F2F` to contractor brand color |
| **Company Name** | `src/lib/ai/knowledge/company.ts`, email templates, metadata | Update company profile in knowledge module |
| **Logo** | `public/images/`, `<Header>`, `<Footer>`, PDF template | Replace logo files (PNG, 200x60px recommended) |
| **Contact Info** | `src/components/footer.tsx`, email templates | Update address, phone, email |
| **Location** | `src/lib/ai/knowledge/company.ts`, `ontario-renovation.ts`, PDF template | Update location in knowledge modules |
| **Social Links** | `src/components/footer.tsx` | Update social media URLs |

### 19.2 Pricing Configuration

All pricing is database-driven via the `admin_settings` table. No code changes required.

| Setting Key | Description | Admin UI Location |
|-------------|-------------|-------------------|
| `pricing_kitchen` | Per-sqft rates for economy/standard/premium | /admin/settings → Pricing tab |
| `pricing_bathroom` | Per-sqft rates for economy/standard/premium | /admin/settings → Pricing tab |
| `pricing_basement` | Per-sqft rates for economy/standard/premium | /admin/settings → Pricing tab |
| `labor_rate_internal` | Hourly rate for in-house labor | /admin/settings → Rates tab |
| `labor_markup_contract` | Markup percentage for subcontractors | /admin/settings → Rates tab |
| `contingency_percent` | Default contingency percentage | /admin/settings → Rates tab |
| `hst_rate` | Provincial tax rate | /admin/settings → Rates tab |
| `deposit_percent` | Required deposit percentage | /admin/settings → Rates tab |
| `quote_validity_days` | How long quotes are valid | /admin/settings → Rates tab |

### 19.3 AI Agent Persona Configuration

Each deployment has three named AI agents. To customize for a new contractor:

| File | What to Change |
|------|----------------|
| `src/lib/ai/knowledge/company.ts` | Company name, team members, hours, location, service area, contact info, social links |
| `src/lib/ai/knowledge/services.ts` | Service types, scopes, and descriptions for this contractor |
| `src/lib/ai/knowledge/pricing.ts` | Per-sqft pricing, labor rates, markup, tax rate, deposit percentage |
| `src/lib/ai/knowledge/ontario-renovation.ts` | Province/state-specific regulations, permits, building codes, seasonal considerations |
| `src/lib/ai/knowledge/sales-techniques.ts` | Usually unchanged (generic sales training) |
| `src/lib/ai/personas/receptionist.ts` | Agent name, greeting, personality traits, voice ID |
| `src/lib/ai/personas/quote-specialist.ts` | Agent name, greeting, personality traits, voice ID |
| `src/lib/ai/personas/design-consultant.ts` | Agent name, greeting, personality traits, voice ID |

**Note:** The prompt assembler (`prompt-assembler.ts`) and persona types (`types.ts`) are universal and should not need changes per deployment.

### 19.4 Service Types

To add or modify service types:

| File | What to Change |
|------|----------------|
| `src/types/database.ts` | Add to `project_type` enum TypeScript type |
| `src/lib/pricing/constants.ts` | Add pricing guidelines for new type |
| `src/lib/ai/knowledge/services.ts` | Add service scope and description |
| `src/lib/ai/knowledge/pricing.ts` | Add pricing ranges for new type |
| `src/lib/schemas/ai-quote.ts` | Add to LINE_ITEM_TEMPLATES |
| Database | Add constraint to `leads.project_type` column |

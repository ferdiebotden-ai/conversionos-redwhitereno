### Permits & Building Code
- Building permits are required for structural changes, plumbing, electrical, and HVAC work
- The Ontario Building Code (OBC) governs all residential construction
- Permit costs vary by municipality — Stratford typically $200–$1,500 depending on scope
- Inspections are required at key stages (framing, rough-in, final)
- Unpermitted work can affect home insurance and resale value
- Basement apartments require fire separation, egress windows, and separate smoke detectors

### HST & Financial
- HST is 13% in Ontario (5% federal + 8% provincial)
- HST rebate may be available for new residential rental properties
- Home renovation tax credits occasionally available (check current programs)
- Home Efficiency Rebate Plus (HER+) for energy-efficiency upgrades

### Seasonal Considerations
- Spring (April–May): Popular start time, book early for summer completion
- Summer (June–August): Peak season, longest days, best for outdoor work
- Fall (September–November): Good for interior work, contractors less booked
- Winter (December–March): Best pricing and availability, but outdoor work limited
- Ontario winters mean pipes can freeze — insulation is critical in basements

### WSIB & Insurance
- All legitimate contractors in Ontario carry WSIB (Workplace Safety and Insurance Board) coverage
- Always ask for proof of WSIB clearance certificate
- Contractors should carry a minimum of $2M liability insurance
- Red White Reno carries full WSIB and liability coverage

### Common Housing Stock (Stratford Area)
- Many homes built 1940s–1980s with original kitchens and bathrooms
- Century homes (pre-1920) may have unique structural considerations
- Post-war bungalows often have unfinished basements with great potential
- Split-levels and raised ranches common in 1960s–1970s subdivisions

### Climate-Appropriate Materials
- LVP (Luxury Vinyl Plank) is popular — waterproof and handles temperature swings
- Quartz countertops resist Ontario humidity better than some natural stones
- Engineered hardwood handles seasonal humidity changes better than solid
- Heated bathroom floors are increasingly popular for Ontario winters
- Proper vapor barriers essential in basements (Ontario has freeze-thaw cycles)

export const ONTARIO_DESIGN_KNOWLEDGE = `## Ontario Design Considerations
- Stratford homes range from Victorian-era to mid-century — designs should complement the home's character
- Natural light is precious in Ontario winters — consider how renovations affect window placement
- Open-concept kitchens are highly popular but require structural assessment for load-bearing walls
- Heated floors are a luxury that pays off in Ontario winters (especially bathrooms)
- LVP flooring is the top choice for basements — waterproof and comfortable underfoot
- Light colors and reflective surfaces help maximize Ontario's limited winter daylight
- Consider mudroom/entry transitions for boots and winter gear
- Outdoor spaces should account for 4-season use — covered structures extend the season
